     <p> this is the next level of my tutorial that is level 3 which is bootstrap 
	 although i dont know anuthing about it but i just hope it would be as simole 
	 and sweet as html and css</p>
	 <p> as i go further into this i hope it increases my passion for web programming and not extinguish the fire<br>
	 but no matter what happens i wont give up because i believe that God will give me the grace to go through and learn what i am supposed to learn<br>
	 however all is well because i believe that learning is a process of patience </p>

		<p> well,thus far all i can say is that the lesson is going really well ,i am happy now
		doing what i am doing because no body forced me into it.some of my guys see it as something riduculous
		but you what ? it seem to be true.</p>
		<p>i would like to stop talking now and face my jod because i figured out that there is no time to waste time
		so good bye for now ,i hope the lesson and tutorial go well ;i believe inGod and myself to.</P>
