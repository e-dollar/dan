     <p> this is the next level of my tutorial that is level 3 which is bootstrap 
	 although i dont know anuthing about it but i just hope it would be as simole 
	 and sweet as html and css</p>
	 <p <style="text-color:red;"> as i go further into this i hope it increases my passion for web programming and not extinguish the fire<br>
	 but no matter what happens i wont give up because i believe that God will give me the grace to go through and learn what i am supposed to learn<br>
	 however all is well because i believe that learning is a process of patience </p>

		so good bye for now ,i hope the lesson and tutorial go well ;i believe inGod and myself to.</p>
